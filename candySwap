// Alice and Bob have candy bars of different sizes: A[i] is the size of the i-th bar of candy that Alice has, and B[j] is the size of the j-th bar of candy that Bob has.

// Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy bar each so that after the exchange, they both have the same total amount of candy.  

// (The total amount of candy a person has is the sum of the sizes of candy bars they have.)

// Return an integer array ans where ans[0] is the size of the candy bar that Alice must exchange, and ans[1] is the size of the candy bar that Bob must exchange.

// If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.
